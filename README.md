# ConnectFour
Working Connect Four bot, right now it works on a console, will work on making a graphics interface now. 
This project was originaly developed in the AI subject I had at ITU, in JAVA. 
Decided to make this into C# to recall the concepts learned.

# April 2021 
I have decided to implement this in unity, and made some improvements to the AI - namely move prioritization, fixes in the end condition checking and details about time taken to calculate the next move for AI/states created.
